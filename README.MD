## This project for supporting research paper " Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction " 

The model in this project is:
1. Data Ingestion,
2. Data Preprocessing -> data cleaning, data imputation, data split
3. Data Augmentation -> Histogram Augmentation Technique (HAT) / Data proportion, Machine Learning Technique (SMOTE), and Deep Learning method (SDT)
4. Train the data using model -> Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Xgboost (all training process using StratifiedKFold Cross Validation method)
5. Evaluation model -> Cunfussion Matrix such as: Recall (TPR), Type I error, F1 score 
6. Final Evaluation -> ANOVA (one way)
